This program takes 4 inputs. First (list1) and second boxes (list2) are for arraylists. Third and fourth box takes strings.
  The way how program works:
    1. It appends the strings which are in boxes 3 and 4. (3 comes first and then 4)
    2. The program will append the characters whose indexes are stored in the arraylist1 at the end of the string which comes from step1. (First Box)
    REMINDER: Please put the numbers in box1 as each line contains one number.
    3. Lastly program will append the integers in the second box again at the end of the modified string from step2.
